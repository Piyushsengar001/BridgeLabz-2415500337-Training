## 🗂️ Timeline

### August 11–13, 2025: Git & GitHub Essentials

- 🛠️ Set up **Git Bash** and mastered version control basics.
- 🔎 Explored differences between `Git`, `Git Bash`, and `GitHub`.
- 💡 Practiced key commands: `init`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `clone`, etc.
- 🚦 Honed *repository management* best practices.
- 📝 Strengthened foundational skills by solving basic Java problems.

---

### August 18–20, 2025: Java Basics

- 📑 Learned Java syntax, keywords, data types, and variables.
- 🏗️ Understood program structure: `main()` method, code flow.
- ⌨️ Practiced input/output programs and setup of the Java environment.

---

### August 25–27, 2025: Control Flow & Arrays

- 🧠 Mastered control statements: `if`, `else`, `switch`, `while`, `for`, `do-while`.
- 🔄 Studied *decision-making & iteration* practices.
- 📊 Explored arrays (1D & 2D): declaration, initialization, traversal.
- 🔁 Implemented nested loops for matrix and array computations.

---

### September 1–3, 2025: Methods & Strings

- ⚡ Tackled edge cases and boundary conditions.
- 🧩 Explored methods: definition, parameters, return types.
- ✂️ Practiced modular programming through user-defined methods.
- 🧵 Delved deep into Strings: manipulation, immutability.
- 🚀 Compared `String`, `StringBuffer`, and `StringBuilder` for efficiency.

---

### September 8–10, 2025: OOP Principles

- 📦 Introduced Object-Oriented Concepts: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction.
- 🏗️ Examined constructors: default, parameterized, copy.
- 🧮 Differentiated instance vs. static variables.
- 🔒 Explored access modifiers and inheritance hierarchies.

---

### September 15–17, 2025: Advanced OOP

- 🎯 Studied interfaces, abstract classes, and deep polymorphism.
- 🛠️ Method overriding, overloading, upcasting, downcasting.
- 🧠 Used abstract classes, methods, and practical interface-abstraction combos.

---

### September 22–24, 2025: Real-Life Java Scenarios

- 🌍 Applied OOP to real scenarios and simulated real-world use cases.
- 🔁 Enhanced modular, reusable code with hands-on problems.

---

### October 13–15, 2025: Interfaces & Lambda

- 🔖 Completed defining and implementing interfaces.
- 📃 Learned about functional, default, static, marker interfaces.
- ⚡ Introduced lambda expressions for functional-style coding.

---

### October 27–29, 2025: Packages & Exception Handling

- 📦 Studied Java packages: organization, import.
- 🪝 Practiced exception handling: `try`, `catch`, `finally`, `throw`, `throws`.
- 🔀 Compared checked/unchecked exceptions, created custom ones.
- 🗃️ Used wrapper classes for autoboxing/unboxing.
- 🎉 Merged packages, exceptions, wrapper classes in practical programs.

---

### November 3–5, 2025: Generics, Collections, JDBC

- 🏷️ Mastered generics for type-safety and reusable code.
- 🗂️ Explored collections: `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, `Map`, implementations (`ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `HashMap`, `TreeMap`).
- 👐 Understood generics within collections for cleaner code.
- 🗄️ Learned JDBC: architecture and connectivity (CRUD operations with MySQL).
- 🔗 Utilized `DriverManager`, `Connection`, `Statement`, `ResultSet` for database interaction.

---

## ✨ Key Technologies

- **Git, Git Bash, GitHub**: Version control & collaboration
- **Java**: Core, OOP, Advanced topics
- **JDBC & MySQL**: Database integration
- **Packages & Exception Handling**: Modular, robust code
